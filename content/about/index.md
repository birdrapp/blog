Birdr was born out of two lifelong interests: birding and computing. While I can’t say I’m an avid birder, I’ve spent enough time in hides and by rubbish tips to appreciate the [love my parents have for birdwatching](https://trevorontour.me/). Tech, on the other hand, is my passion. Having built my first website at the age of 13 I’ve never looked back. I studied Computer Science at university, obtained a Ph.D and, more recently, had the opportunity to work on [BBC iPlayer](http://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer).

Over the past decade I have built [numerous](http://birdlists.me/) [bird watching](http://nenbc.co.uk/) [websites](/post/welcome-to-birdr/) - some more successful than others. This blog is documenting my latest attempt - to build the world’s largest birding community. I will use Birdr as an opportunity to learn new tech, such as: [Go](https://golang.org/), [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) and [Kubernetes](http://kubernetes.io/). Over the course of it’s development I will provide updates on progress, as well as attempting to explain these technologies to the bird watchers among you.

If you’re interested in getting involved in the project, either as a birder or a developer, feel free to [get in touch](mailto:matt@birdr.co.uk). If you’d like to know more about my background, check out [my profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/matthew-williams).
