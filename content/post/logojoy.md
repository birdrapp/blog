*Time passes exponentially quicker these days. It seems like only yesterday I finished writing my previous post - yet here we are, 2 months later.*

In an attempt to spark me back into life I'm writing a micro-post. In a series I've imaginitavely called flyby I will cover small topics that would bore you if I tried to write a full post about them; starting with [Logojoy](https://www.logojoy.com/)

### Logo love

I'm a sucker for a pretty logo, who isn't? In fact, it's probably one of the first things I start to think about. Over the years I've had several attempts at making a logo myself and even hiring professional graphic designers. Unfortunately, the results haven't always impressed.

One lunchtime while I was browsing [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/news) I stumbled upon [an article by a graphic designer](https://www.indiehackers.com/businesses/logojoy). He was bemoaning the fact that the majority of his clients never afforded him the opportunity to flex his creative muscle. No matter how creative his solutions would be, his clients would inevitably prefer something far simpler - an icon with text. Frustrated with spending his time creating these simple logos he decided to build a machine learning application that allowed people to select a few logos they like and it would create a logo specifically for them. And thus, [Logojoy](https://www.logojoy.com/) was born!

To be honest I didn't have high hopes, how can a machine create a logo better than a human? I have to be honest, the results are often brilliant. So much so, I decided to purchase the Birdr logo from there. What do you think:

The cost to me? **$65**! A bargain. Why not [try creating your own logo for free?](https://www.logojoy.com/app.php)
