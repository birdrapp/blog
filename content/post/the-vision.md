What is it about Birdr that keeps me coming back? Why can't I let the idea die? Ultimately I feel that there is a great opportunity to use technology to enhance a fascinating hobby - it is a shame no one has done it justice thus far. Perhaps the subject matter is too niche for most developers (I suspect there isn't much money in it) and most bird watchers can't appreciate how much technology can progress their hobby.

Regardless of the reasons, I have a vision of what Birdr could be, rattling around my head, and for the first time I'm going to attempt to sell that vision to you.

### The Basics

In the software development world there is a concept of a Minimum Viable Product (MVP). [INSERT SENTENCE ABOUT MVP]. What would be considered an MVP for Birdr? For me, it would be:

 * the ablity to record bird sightings
 * group those sightings into lists

It is unlikely that this would progress birding in any way shape or form. However, recording and listing are the essence of bird watching and it is critical that we get them right. All the features that follow essentially build on being able to easily record the birds you see.

#### A note on international birders

For the non-birders among you, bird lists aren't trivial. I'll write a post about the nuances of bird lists in the future but for now it is enough to know that we should support birders from all around the globe.

### The Advanced

Where can we go once we able to record our birds?

#### Smart Lists

Compare to birdlists, how can we do better, how might it work?

#### Photos

Nothing new, but a nice online gallery for all your bird photos. Tagged with the species information. Will feed into an advanced feature (link).

#### Trip Reports

Tie records together in time and space to create a 'trip'. This is like a journal of your travels. Includes maps, photos, lists, text.

#### Weather

We can automatically add weather details to all your records. Weather plays an important part in birding - especially wind.

#### Clubs

Think Facebook groups. Form a bird club, invite members, draw a club territory, get club records, photos etc. Talk about state of bird club sites, discuss the potential of a standard reporting format (feeding into parent clubs).

#### Gamification

On boarding for younger birders. Earn badges for seeing things. Suggest badges to work on. Make them fun/unusual to encourage different birding behaviour? Leader boards.

#### Notifications

Like a news feed. Talk about pagers, birdguides etc. Crowd sourced records and real-time text message notifications of birds near your location.

#### Reputation

Create a reputation system. Identifying birds is hard, you'll make mistakes when you're new. Don't automatically alert on mistakes. Allow users to report a record as dubious. Feed into ML?

#### Follow friends

Create a list of birders you're interested in. See what they've seen etc...

#### Encyclopedia

Side effect of all these records is we build up an encyclopedia of bird information. Photos, records, locations, weather etc.

### The Future

#### Image Recognition

Is it possible to create records simply by uploading photos?? We know date, time, location, weather and maybe species? Who knows.

#### Machine Learning

Can we use machine learning techniques to identify dubius records before they're submitted?
