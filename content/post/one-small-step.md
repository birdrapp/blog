Time passes exponentially quicker these days. It seems like only yesterday when I finished writing my previous post - yet here we are, 2 months later.

#### Good news everyone!

I am happy to announce that I have made some progress... of sorts. I have started to create the [bird service](https://github.com/birdrapp/ibis). This service will form the heart of birdr. Almost all other services will interact with this in some form or another. It also is one of the simplest services providing only basic lookup and retrieval operations.
